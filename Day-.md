Version control is a fundamental concept in software development that helps manage changes to code over time. GitHub is a popular version control tool because it is built on top of the Git VCS. Due to traceablity collaboration and branching github helps maintain project integrity in several ways 
Create new repository => intialize the repository => add a .gitignore file 
A GitHub repository's README file is an essential part because it provides prospective users, contributors, and anyone else interested in your work with an overview of your project. README file contribute to effective collaboration in several ways. like communication maintainablity discoverablity <ADVANTAGE> Include : opportunity to recieve feedback and contribution from other developer <Disadvantage> information will exposed 
clone the repository => change directory =>  stage the change => create the commit => git push  
Branching is a fundamental feature in Git that allows developers to diverge from the main codebase, work on new features or bug fixes, and then merge those changes back into the main branch. Branching is an essential component of collaborative development on GitHub, as it enables multiple developers to work on different aspects of a project simultaneously without interfering with each other's work.
Forking is a GitHub-specific concept that allows you to create a copy of a repository that you don't own. This copy, known as a "fork," is essentially a duplicate of the original repository, but it exists in your own GitHub account.
Issues are the primary way to track bugs, feature requests, and other tasks within a GitHub repository.GitHub's project boards are a powerful tool for organizing and managing the various tasks and issues within a repository.
Utilizing GitHub for version control can provide numerous benefits, but it also comes with its own set of challenges that both new and experienced users may encounter. Reflecting on these common challenges and best practices can help ensure smooth collaboration and effective use of GitHub's features.
